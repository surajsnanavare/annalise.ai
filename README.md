## Question Answer

- What would your ideal environment look like and how does this fit into it?
> In ideal environment application will be running in Cloud like AWS, GCP, etc. All Image files can be stores in AWS S3 or cloud storages. Application will be deployed using docker, code pipelines (for automated deployments). 

- How are subsequent deployments made?
> CI/CD setup can be done using github actions, AWS Codepipeline(Preferred) or using shell script and github webhooks.

- How could you avoid downtime during deployments?
> Working with orchestration system like ECS, Kubernetes, etc creates new vms for deployment, test them and run them. This make sure that downtime is very minimal or zero.
